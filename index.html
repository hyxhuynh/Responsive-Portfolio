            <p>
                I graduated from University of Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Molecular, Cellular and Developemntal Biology. Upon graduation, I have worked in various fields, such as the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industries. In 2015, I moved to Clackamas, OR to work for a nutraceutical company and was first introduced to the state of art technique of the Inductively Coupled Mass Spectrometry instruments in the Organic Chemistry field. I am back to Seattle in 2017 to be closer with my family, and I am extremely excited to be a part of the UW Coding Bootcamp. I am looking forward to changing my career in the tech field.

                I volunteered at the Seattle Aquarium and joined their Beach Naturalist program for few months after graduation in 2014. I have learned a lot from the program and met many people were very passionate about protecting the environment. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends, hiking, practicing yoga, and cooking.
